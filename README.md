## Background
Light Archer is a virtual reality arcade game made in unity. The player must simply shoot incoming targets with a bow and arrow before they get too close. These targets spawn in the front hemisphere of the player. When a target collides with a player, they lose a life. As more targets are shot down and points are accumilated, more targets will spawn and they will arrive faster. The game has infinitely scaling difficulty.
